          <p>I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics and a minor in Spanish. I have worked in the aerospace & aviation industry for the past three years, and I am currently working in the federal & defense space helping customers realize the value from complex analytical strategies and projects. My interests are in statistics and mathematics, particularly their applications to data science, machine learning and AI.</p>

            <h3>Project 1: Multiple Linear Regression to Predict Fish Weight</h3>
            <p>I recently read an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/14/1129018076/fishing-tournament-cheating-felony-charges-runyan-cominsky-lake-erie-walleye">article</a> about two men who were caught cheating during a fishing tournament. Being an avid fisherman myself, I couldn't help but wonder if there could have been a way to detect the cheating with an algorithm. When catching a fish, one may want to record the weight along with several other measurements. I can imagine visually inspecting a fish, and provide a best guess as to how much that fish would weigh. If I saw a rather small perch or walleye, and grabbed it and thought "wow this is heavier than I thought," then I may want to investigate further. And this is exactly how the two fishermen were caught! The fishing tournament organizer looked at the rather normal looking fish and thought they couldn't possibly weigh that much. If a human can come to that conclusion with their own intuition, what could a machine learning model do? Perhaps it could prevent things like this from happening. This analysis is just a first pass at a simple model, and of course one could always take it a step further.</p>
